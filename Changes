Revision history for Perl extension Convert::TNEF.

        - There was two purge methods. I purged one of them (the bad one).
        - fixed a die() in the parse method to return a failure status instead.
        - Took out the subclasses which were just aliases for
          for MIME::Body::*, and weren't really proper subclasses anyway.
          I forget why I did it that way, maybe I planned on making some
          extra methods later, or just to see if it worked.
          There really should be separate classes for a TNEF object,
          and for the attachments in the TNEF object, maybe someday I'll
          get around to it.

        - fixed and cleaned up some of the debug output.
        - had the bright idea in the first release of including a
          name() method for attachments and put it in the documentation,
          but neglected to actually include the method in the code.
        - Found out that the 'AttachTitle' attribute returns only the
          short (8 char + 3 char extension) version of the filename, so I
          included a 'longname' method which does its best to get the long
          version of the filename. This is extracted out of the 'Attachment'
          attribute data, which is a binary field, and I don't really know
          how to parse this field, but this seems to work to get the name.
